# TCP Connection Pool

This project is an entry task that I have completed as a junior engineer.

For a detailed explanation of the TCP pool, check out my [Medium](https://medium.com/better-programming/build-a-tcp-connection-pool-from-scratch-with-go-d7747023fe14) article.

## Getting Started

To start HTTP client,

`go run app/http/*`

To start TCP server,

`go run app/tcp/*`

To see available config flags,

`go run app/http/* -help`

`go run app/tcp/* -help`
